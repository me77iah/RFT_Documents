Other Comments.

Good practice to reebot system, then go through the above checklist on restart.
Turn off the MONITOR ('Don't Sleep') convinces RFT that the monitor is on :-)

Daily reboots occur on the prelive environments, around midnight.
Saturday evenings at 10PM. Something major happens, sytems go down, and can be offline for a considerable time (monday AM)?
